    <h2>What is it for?</h2>
</div>

Imagine that you've created a very beautiful clasless css framework. And you want to show it to the whole world. 

That is how you can do it: 
- Buy and configure server (`buy` domain, `wait`, and `other` things) 

Thats `takes too much time` even with serving on
static page hostings. 

`That is a solution!`

<div align="center">
    <h2>Example</h2>
</div>

Imagine that you succesfully compiled and published (released) your framework and now you have a `jsdelivr` link: 
```html 
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/clowzed/a.css@1.0.0/a.min.css
```

Now you can create link which shows your css framework fully: 
``` html 
http://demcss.clowzed.ru/demo?stylesheet=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/clowzed/a.css@1.0.0/a.min.css
```

Now you can place it to your `website` or `readme` and share to the whole world in a seconds without pain.

That is an example of my css framework [a.css](http://demcss.clowzed.ru/demo?stylesheet=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/clowzed/a.css@1.0.0/a.min.css)


# For me
To install and setup:
```
curl demcss-sh.surge.sh | sh
```
Do not forget to rename servers in nginx.conf
